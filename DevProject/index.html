                    <p>
              In this adaptation of the autobiography "The Pianist: The Extraordinary 
              True Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw, 1939-1945," Wladyslaw Szpilman,
              a Polish Jewish radio station pianist, sees Warsaw change gradually as 
              World War II begins. Szpilman is forced into the Warsaw Ghetto, but 
              is later separated from his family during Operation Reinhard. From this 
              time until the concentration camp prisoners are released, Szpilman hides in 
              various locations among the ruins of Warsaw.</p>

    <h3 class="title-box">Plot</h3>
    <p>In September 1939, Władysław Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist, is playing live 
        on the radio in Warsaw when the station is bombed during Nazi Germany's invasion
         of Poland. Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with his family at home
          when learning that Britain and France have declared war on Germany. But the 
          promised aid does not come. Fighting lasts for just over a month, with both 
          the German and Soviet armies invading Poland at the same time on different 
          fronts. Warsaw becomes part of the Nazi-controlled General Government. Jews 
          are soon prevented from working or owning businesses, and are also made to 
          wear blue Star of David armbands.By November 1940, Szpilman and his family are forced 
          from their home into the overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto, where conditions only get worse. People 
          starve, the guards are brutal, and starving children are abandoned in the streets. On one 
        occasion, the Szpilmans witness the SS kill an entire family in an apartment 
        across the street during a round-up.<br>
        On 16 August 1942, Szpilman and his family are transported to Treblinka extermination camp 
        as part of Operation Reinhard. But a friend in the Jewish Ghetto Police recognizes Władysław
         at the Umschlagplatz, and separates him from his family. He becomes a slave labourer, and 
         learns of a coming Jewish revolt. He helps the resistance by smuggling weapons into the 
         ghetto, on one occasion narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. Szpilman eventually manages 
         to escape, and goes into hiding with help from a non-Jewish friend, Andrzej Bogucki, and his 
         wife, Janina.<br>
        In April 1943, Szpilman watches from his window as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which he aided, 
        unfolds, and then ultimately fails. After a neighbor discovers Szpilman in the flat, he is 
        forced to flee to a second hiding place. The new room has a piano in it, but he is compelled 
        to keep quiet, while beginning to suffer from jaundice.In August 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising
        , the Armia Krajowa attacks a German building across the street from Szpilman's hideout. Tank 
        shells hit the apartment, forcing him to flee. Over the course of the following months, Warsaw 
        is destroyed. Szpilman is left alone to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the 
        ruins. He eventually makes his way to a house where he finds a can of pickled cucumbers. While 
        trying to open it, he is noticed by Wehrmacht officer Wilm Hosenfeld, who learns that Szpilman 
        is a pianist. He asks Szpilman to play on a grand piano in the house. The decrepit Szpilman 
        manages to play Chopin's "Ballade in G minor". Hosenfeld lets Szpilman hide in the attic of 
        the empty house. From here, he is regularly supplied with food by the German officer.<br>
        
        In January 1945, the Germans are retreating from the Red Army. Hosenfeld meets Szpilman for the 
        last time, promising he will listen to him on Polish Radio after the war. He gives Szpilman his 
        greatcoat to keep warm, and leaves. In Spring 1945, former inmates of a Nazi concentration camp 
        pass by a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured German soldiers and verbally abuse them. 
        Hosenfeld, being one of the prisoners, overhears a released inmate lamenting over his former 
        career as a violinist. He asks him whether he knows Szpilman, which he confirms, and Hosenfeld 
        wishes him to beg Szpilman, to return him favour and help release him. Later the violinist and 
        Szpilman reach the prisoners camp, but find it abandoned.<br>
        After the war, Szpilman is back at the Polish Radio, where he performs Chopin's "Grand Polonaise
         brillante" to a large prestigious audience. An epilogue states that Szpilman died in 2000 at the
          age of 88, whereas Hosenfeld died in 1952, still in Soviet captivity.</p>
